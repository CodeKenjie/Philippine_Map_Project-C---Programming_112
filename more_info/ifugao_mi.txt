Top Attractions – Ifugao
Banaue Rice Terraces (Banaue)
The most famous place in Ifugao. These rice terraces were 
carved into the mountains over 2,000 years ago by the Ifugao 
people. Called the "Eighth Wonder of the World". Great for 
sightseeing and photos.

Batad Rice Terraces (Banaue)
A part of the Banaue Rice Terraces but more remote and peaceful. 
It’s shaped like an amphitheater. You need to hike to get there, 
but the view is amazing.

A tall and powerful waterfall near the Batad Rice Terraces. 
You can swim in the cold, fresh water after hiking down.

Another beautiful rice terrace system with hot springs nearby. 
Less crowded than Banaue, but just as stunning.

Older and still used by locals today. Surrounded by mountains 
and forests—great for nature trips.

Mt. Napulawan (Hungduan)
A challenging mountain to hike. Offers scenic views and 
a cool climate. Best for experienced hikers.
